# 🎨 guggenheim_scraper

## Project Description

**guggenheim_scraper** is a Python project designed to collect, clean, and explore data from the Peggy Guggenheim Museum’s collection in Venice.

The project builds a comprehensive database of artworks and provides insights into artist representation, historical periods, and the display/storage status of the collection.

This is an end-to-end workflow: from web scraping to cleaned datasets, ready for analysis and visualization.


## 📂 Repository Contents

### Dataset

- **gughenheim-venezia-opere-tutte-le-pagine-csv.csv**  
  The full dataset of artworks scraped from the museum website, cleaned and structured.

### 📓 Notebooks

- **scraping_gughenem.ipynb**  
  Contains all the code to:
  - 🕸️ Scrape the museum website using BeautifulSoup  
  - 💾 Save the raw dataset for further cleaning  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Data cleaning and standardization were performed using **OpenRefine**, to handle inconsistencies, normalize artist names, and structure the dataset for analysis.

### 📊 Project Presentations

- **Peggy_Guggenheim_Part_1.pdf**  
- **Peggy_Guggenheim_Part_2.pdf**

Presentations of the work carried out for the project.  
The first presentation focuses on **data scraping and data cleaning**, while the second presentation focuses on **data presentation and dashboard creation**.

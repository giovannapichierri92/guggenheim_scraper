🎨 guggenheim_scraper
Project Description
guggenheim_scraper is a Python project designed to collect, clean, and explore data from the Peggy Guggenheim Museum’s collection in Venice.
The project builds a comprehensive database of artworks and provides insights into artist representation, historical periods, and the display/storage status of the collection.
This is an end-to-end workflow: from web scraping to cleaned datasets, ready for analysis and visualization.
 
📂 Repository Contents
Dataset
•	gughenheim-venezia-opere-tutte-le-pagine-csv.csv
The full dataset of artworks scraped from the museum website, cleaned and structured.
📓 Notebooks
•	scraping_gughenem.ipynb
Contains all the code to:
o	🕸️ Scrape the museum website using BeautifulSoup
o	💾 Save the raw dataset for further cleaning
🧹 Data Cleaning

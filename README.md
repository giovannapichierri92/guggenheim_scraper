🎨 I created a database of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice to dig into one of the most iconic modern art collections.  

Here’s what I explored:  
- 🖼️ How artworks are catalogued – and whether there are inconsistencies  
- 📊 How many pieces are on display vs in storage  
- 👩‍🎨 Which artists are most represented  
- 🏛️ Which historical periods the collection covers  
- 🔍 How the collection evolved over time  

Tools & workflow I used:  
- 🖥️ **Selenium** for web scraping  
- 🧹 **KNIME** for data cleaning and prep  
- 📊 **Tableau** for creating cool visualizations  

A Python-based, end-to-end project to scrape, clean, and visualize art collection data – perfect for discovering trends, insights, and building a portfolio-ready showcase.
